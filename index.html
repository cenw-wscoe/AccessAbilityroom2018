			 <p>This session will focus on various aspects of the staffing process and practices related to creating an inclusive and equitable process for candidates with a wide variety of disabilities.  Resources, Processes, Best practices and different approaches will be discussed.  Participants will walk away with concrete actionable items to improve the user experience for people with disabilities during staffing processes. </p>
			 <p>The primary concern is to assess the candidate on a level playing field with all other test-takers.  This equitable user experience can include the modification of the testing material itself as well as modification of the testing environment in which the test is administered.  </p>
			 <p>This presentation will cover some of these testing and environmental issues that can prevent a candidate from having a fair and equitable testing experience. Examples elaborated on test creation taking into account all potential test takers; visual impairment (slight to severe, various psychological impairments e.g. math anxiety, mobility impairments, other impairments e.g. environment. </p>
